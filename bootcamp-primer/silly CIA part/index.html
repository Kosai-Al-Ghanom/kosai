                    LANGLEY ,VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspwctor General revealedthet that 
                    the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence with black 
                    Highlighters.

                    According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
